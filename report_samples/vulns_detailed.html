(CVE-2019-19126)<br><br>  - The iconv feature in the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) through 2.32, when processing invalid multi-     byte input sequences in the EUC-KR encoding, may have a buffer over-read. (CVE-2019-25013)<br><br>  - The GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) before 2.32 could overflow an on-stack buffer during range     reduction if an input to an 80-bit long double function contains a non-canonical bit pattern, a seen when     passing a 0x5d414141414141410000 value to sinl on x86 targets. This is related to     sysdeps/ieee754/ldbl-96/e_rem_pio2l.c. (CVE-2020-10029)<br><br>  - sysdeps/i386/ldbl2mpn.c in the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) before 2.23 on x86 targets has a stack-     based buffer overflow if the input to any of the printf family of functions is an 80-bit long double with     a non-canonical bit pattern, as seen when passing a \x00\x04\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x04 value to     sprintf. NOTE: the issue does not affect glibc by default in 2016 or later (i.e., 2.23 or later) because     of commits made in 2015 for inlining of C99 math functions through use of GCC built-ins. In other words,     the reference to 2.23 is intentional despite the mention of Fixed for glibc 2.33 in the 26649 reference.<br>    (CVE-2020-29573)<br><br>Note that Nessus has not tested for this issue but has instead relied only on the application's self-reported version number.</td>

<tr><td valign=top colspan=3 class=plugdesc>The version of openssl installed on the remote host is prior to 1.0.2k-16.154. It is, therefore, affected by a vulnerability as referenced in the ALAS-2021-1541 advisory.<br><br>  - ASN.1 strings are represented internally within OpenSSL as an ASN1_STRING structure which contains a     buffer holding the string data and a field holding the buffer length. This contrasts with normal C strings     which are repesented as a buffer for the string data which is terminated with a NUL (0) byte. Although not     a strict requirement, ASN.1 strings that are parsed using OpenSSL's own d2i functions (and other similar     parsing functions) as well as any string whose value has been set with the ASN1_STRING_set() function will     additionally NUL terminate the byte array in the ASN1_STRING structure. However, it is possible for     applications to directly construct valid ASN1_STRING structures which do not NUL terminate the byte array     by directly setting the data and length fields in the ASN1_STRING array. This can also happen by using     the ASN1_STRING_set0() function. Numerous OpenSSL functions that print ASN.1 data have been found to     assume that the ASN1_STRING byte array will be NUL terminated, even though this is not guaranteed for     strings that have been directly constructed. Where an application requests an ASN.1 structure to be     printed, and where that ASN.1 structure contains ASN1_STRINGs that have been directly constructed by the     application without NUL terminating the data field, then a read buffer overrun can occur. The same thing     can also occur during name constraints processing of certificates (for example if a certificate has been     directly constructed by the application instead of loading it via the OpenSSL parsing functions, and the     certificate contains non NUL terminated ASN1_STRING structures). It can also occur in the     X509_get1_email(), X509_REQ_get1_email() and X509_get1_ocsp() functions. If a malicious actor can cause an     application to directly construct an ASN1_STRING and then process it through one of the affected OpenSSL     functions then this issue could be hit. This might result in a crash (causing a Denial of Service attack).<br>    It could also result in the disclosure of private memory contents (such as private keys, or sensitive     plaintext). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1l (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1k). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2za (Affected     1.0.2-1.0.2y).

However, the scp client only performs cursory validation of the object name returned (only directory traversal attacks are prevented). A malicious scp server (or Man-in-The-Middle attacker) can overwrite arbitrary files in the scp client target directory. If recursive operation (-r) is performed, the server can manipulate subdirectories as well (for example, to overwrite the .ssh/authorized_keys file). (CVE-2019-6111)<br><br>In OpenSSH 7.9, scp.c in the scp client allows remote SSH servers to bypass intended access restrictions via the filename of . or an empty filename. The impact is modifying the permissions of the target directory on the client side. (CVE-2018-20685)</td>

<tr><td valign=top colspan=3 class=plugdesc>The remote Ubuntu 16.04 LTS host has packages installed that are affected by a vulnerability as referenced in the USN-5051-2 advisory.<br><br>  - ASN.1 strings are represented internally within OpenSSL as an ASN1_STRING structure which contains a     buffer holding the string data and a field holding the buffer length. This contrasts with normal C strings     which are repesented as a buffer for the string data which is terminated with a NUL (0) byte. Although not     a strict requirement, ASN.1 strings that are parsed using OpenSSL's own d2i functions (and other similar     parsing functions) as well as any string whose value has been set with the ASN1_STRING_set() function will     additionally NUL terminate the byte array in the ASN1_STRING structure. However, it is possible for     applications to directly construct valid ASN1_STRING structures which do not NUL terminate the byte array     by directly setting the data and length fields in the ASN1_STRING array. This can also happen by using     the ASN1_STRING_set0() function. Numerous OpenSSL functions that print ASN.1 data have been found to     assume that the ASN1_STRING byte array will be NUL terminated, even though this is not guaranteed for     strings that have been directly constructed. Where an application requests an ASN.1 structure to be     printed, and where that ASN.1 structure contains ASN1_STRINGs that have been directly constructed by the     application without NUL terminating the data field, then a read buffer overrun can occur. The same thing     can also occur during name constraints processing of certificates (for example if a certificate has been     directly constructed by the application instead of loading it via the OpenSSL parsing functions, and the     certificate contains non NUL terminated ASN1_STRING structures).

<tr><td valign=top colspan=3 class=plugdesc>The server's X.509 certificate cannot be trusted. This situation can occur in three different ways, in which the chain of trust can be broken, as stated below :<br><br>  - First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the     server might not be descended from a known public     certificate authority. This can occur either when the     top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed     certificate, or when intermediate certificates are     missing that would connect the top of the certificate     chain to a known public certificate authority.<br><br>  - Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate     that is not valid at the time of the scan. This can     occur either when the scan occurs before one of the     certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the     certificate's 'notAfter' dates.<br><br>  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature     that either didn't match the certificate's information     or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by     getting the certificate with the bad signature to be     re-signed by its issuer. Signatures that could not be     verified are the result of the certificate's issuer     using a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not     support or does not recognize.<br><br>If the remote host is a public host in production, any break in the chain makes it more difficult for users to verify the authenticity and identity of the web server. This could make it easier to carry out man-in-the-middle attacks against the remote host.</td>

<tr><td valign=top colspan=3 class=plugdesc>The remote Ubuntu 16.04 LTS host has packages installed that are affected by a vulnerability as referenced in the USN-5051-2 advisory.<br><br>  - ASN.1 strings are represented internally within OpenSSL as an ASN1_STRING structure which contains a     buffer holding the string data and a field holding the buffer length. This contrasts with normal C strings     which are repesented as a buffer for the string data which is terminated with a NUL (0) byte. Although not     a strict requirement, ASN.1 strings that are parsed using OpenSSL's own d2i functions (and other similar     parsing functions) as well as any string whose value has been set with the ASN1_STRING_set() function will     additionally NUL terminate the byte array in the ASN1_STRING structure. However, it is possible for     applications to directly construct valid ASN1_STRING structures which do not NUL terminate the byte array     by directly setting the data and length fields in the ASN1_STRING array. This can also happen by using     the ASN1_STRING_set0() function. Numerous OpenSSL functions that print ASN.1 data have been found to     assume that the ASN1_STRING byte array will be NUL terminated, even though this is not guaranteed for     strings that have been directly constructed. Where an application requests an ASN.1 structure to be     printed, and where that ASN.1 structure contains ASN1_STRINGs that have been directly constructed by the     application without NUL terminating the data field, then a read buffer overrun can occur. The same thing     can also occur during name constraints processing of certificates (for example if a certificate has been     directly constructed by the application instead of loading it via the OpenSSL parsing functions, and the     certificate contains non NUL terminated ASN1_STRING structures). It can also occur in the     X509_get1_email(), X509_REQ_get1_email() and X509_get1_ocsp() functions. If a malicious actor can cause an     application to directly construct an ASN1_STRING and then process it through one of the affected OpenSSL     functions then this issue could be hit. This might result in a crash (causing a Denial of Service attack).<br>    It could also result in the disclosure of private memory contents (such as private keys, or sensitive     plaintext). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1j (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1k). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2za (Affected     1.0.2-1.0.2y).

<tr><td valign=top colspan=3 class=plugdesc>The remote Ubuntu 16.04 LTS host has packages installed that are affected by a vulnerability as referenced in the USN-5051-2 advisory.<br><br>  - ASN.1 strings are represented internally within OpenSSL as an ASN1_STRING structure which contains a     buffer holding the string data and a field holding the buffer length. This contrasts with normal C strings     which are repesented as a buffer for the string data which is terminated with a NUL (0) byte. Although not     a strict requirement, ASN.1 strings that are parsed using OpenSSL's own d2i functions (and other similar     parsing functions) as well as any string whose value has been set with the ASN1_STRING_set() function will     additionally NUL terminate the byte array in the ASN1_STRING structure. However, it is possible for     applications to directly construct valid ASN1_STRING structures which do not NUL terminate the byte array     by directly setting the data and length fields in the ASN1_STRING array. This can also happen by using     the ASN1_STRING_set0() function. Numerous OpenSSL functions that print ASN.1 data have been found to     assume that the ASN1_STRING byte array will be NUL terminated, even though this is not guaranteed for     strings that have been directly constructed. Where an application requests an ASN.1 structure to be     printed, and where that ASN.1 structure contains ASN1_STRINGs that have been directly constructed by the     application without NUL terminating the data field, then a read buffer overrun can occur. The same thing     can also occur during name constraints processing of certificates (for example if a certificate has been     directly constructed by the application instead of loading it via the OpenSSL parsing functions, and the     certificate contains non NUL terminated ASN1_STRING structures). It can also occur in the     X509_get1_email(), X509_REQ_get1_email() and X509_get1_ocsp() functions. If a malicious actor can cause an     application to directly construct an ASN1_STRING and then process it through one of the affected OpenSSL     functions then this issue could be hit. This might result in a crash (causing a Denial of Service attack).<br>    It could also result in the disclosure of private memory contents (such as private keys, or sensitive     plaintext). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1j (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1k). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2za (Affected     1.0.2-1.0.2y).

<tr><td valign=top colspan=3 class=plugdesc>The remote Ubuntu 16.04 LTS host has packages installed that are affected by a vulnerability as referenced in the USN-5051-2 advisory.<br><br>  - ASN.1 strings are represented internally within OpenSSL as an ASN1_STRING structure which contains a     buffer holding the string data and a field holding the buffer length. This contrasts with normal C strings     which are repesented as a buffer for the string data which is terminated with a NUL (0) byte. Although not     a strict requirement, ASN.1 strings that are parsed using OpenSSL's own d2i functions (and other similar     parsing functions) as well as any string whose value has been set with the ASN1_STRING_set() function will     additionally NUL terminate the byte array in the ASN1_STRING structure. However, it is possible for     applications to directly construct valid ASN1_STRING structures which do not NUL terminate the byte array     by directly setting the data and length fields in the ASN1_STRING array. This can also happen by using     the ASN1_STRING_set0() function. Numerous OpenSSL functions that print ASN.1 data have been found to     assume that the ASN1_STRING byte array will be NUL terminated, even though this is not guaranteed for     strings that have been directly constructed. Where an application requests an ASN.1 structure to be     printed, and where that ASN.1 structure contains ASN1_STRINGs that have been directly constructed by the     application without NUL terminating the data field, then a read buffer overrun can occur. The same thing     can also occur during name constraints processing of certificates (for example if a certificate has been     directly constructed by the application instead of loading it via the OpenSSL parsing functions, and the     certificate contains non NUL terminated ASN1_STRING structures). It can also occur in the     X509_get1_email(), X509_REQ_get1_email() and X509_get1_ocsp() functions. If a malicious actor can cause an     application to directly construct an ASN1_STRING and then process it through one of the affected OpenSSL     functions then this issue could be hit. This might result in a crash (causing a Denial of Service attack).<br>    It could also result in the disclosure of private memory contents (such as private keys, or sensitive     plaintext).
