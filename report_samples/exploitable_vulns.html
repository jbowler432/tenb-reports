<tr><td><b>158937</b></td><td>Ubuntu 16.04 LTS : OpenSSL vulnerability (USN-5328-2)</td><td>The remote Ubuntu host is missing a security update.</td><td align=center>6</td><td class=medium>medium</td>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td valign=top>The remote Ubuntu 16.04 LTS host has packages installed that are affected by a vulnerability as referenced in the USN-5328-2 advisory.<br><br>  - The BN_mod_sqrt() function, which computes a modular square root, contains a bug that can cause it to loop     forever for non-prime moduli. Internally this function is used when parsing certificates that contain     elliptic curve public keys in compressed form or explicit elliptic curve parameters with a base point     encoded in compressed form. It is possible to trigger the infinite loop by crafting a certificate that has     invalid explicit curve parameters. Since certificate parsing happens prior to verification of the     certificate signature, any process that parses an externally supplied certificate may thus be subject to a     denial of service attack. The infinite loop can also be reached when parsing crafted private keys as they     can contain explicit elliptic curve parameters. Thus vulnerable situations include: - TLS clients     consuming server certificates - TLS servers consuming client certificates - Hosting providers taking     certificates or private keys from customers - Certificate authorities parsing certification requests from     subscribers - Anything else which parses ASN.1 elliptic curve parameters Also any other applications that     use the BN_mod_sqrt() where the attacker can control the parameter values are vulnerable to this DoS     issue. In the OpenSSL 1.0.2 version the public key is not parsed during initial parsing of the certificate     which makes it slightly harder to trigger the infinite loop. However any operation which requires the     public key from the certificate will trigger the infinite loop. In particular the attacker can use a self-     signed certificate to trigger the loop during verification of the certificate signature. This issue     affects OpenSSL versions 1.0.2, 1.1.1 and 3.0. It was addressed in the releases of 1.1.1n and 3.0.2 on the     15th March 2022. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.2 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1n (Affected     1.1.1-1.1.1m). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2zd (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2zc).

<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td valign=top>The remote Ubuntu 16.04 LTS host has packages installed that are affected by a vulnerability as referenced in the USN-5252-2 advisory.<br><br>  - A local privilege escalation vulnerability was found on polkit's pkexec utility. The pkexec application is     a setuid tool designed to allow unprivileged users to run commands as privileged users according     predefined policies. The current version of pkexec doesn't handle the calling parameters count correctly     and ends trying to execute environment variables as commands. An attacker can leverage this by crafting     environment variables in such a way it'll induce pkexec to execute arbitrary code. When successfully     executed the attack can cause a local privilege escalation given unprivileged users administrative rights     on the target machine.

<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td valign=top>The remote Ubuntu 14.04 LTS / 16.04 LTS / 18.04 LTS / 20.04 LTS host has packages installed that are affected by a vulnerability as referenced in the USN-5380-1 advisory.<br><br>  - An issue was discovered in disable_priv_mode in shell.c in GNU Bash through 5.0 patch 11. By default, if     Bash is run with its effective UID not equal to its real UID, it will drop privileges by setting its     effective UID to its real UID. However, it does so incorrectly. On Linux and other systems that support     saved UID functionality, the saved UID is not dropped. An attacker with command execution in the shell     can use enable -f for runtime loading of a new builtin, which can be a shared object that calls setuid()     and therefore regains privileges.

If this is not the case, they     assume that a following removal of the granted access will always succeed, which is not true in case the     backend has mapped the granted page between those two operations. As a result the backend can keep access     to the memory page of the guest no matter how the page will be used after the frontend I/O has finished.<br>    The xenbus driver has a similar problem, as it doesn't check the success of removing the granted access of     a shared ring buffer. blkfront: CVE-2022-23036 netfront: CVE-2022-23037 scsifront: CVE-2022-23038     gntalloc: CVE-2022-23039 xenbus: CVE-2022-23040 blkfront, netfront, scsifront, usbfront, dmabuf, xenbus,     9p, kbdfront, and pvcalls are using a functionality to delay freeing a grant reference until it is no     longer in use, but the freeing of the related data page is not synchronized with dropping the granted     access. As a result the backend can keep access to the memory page even after it has been freed and then     re-used for a different purpose. CVE-2022-23041 netfront will fail a BUG_ON() assertion if it fails to     revoke access in the rx path.

<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td valign=top>The version of Firefox installed on the remote Windows host is prior to 66.0. It is, therefore, affected by multiple vulnerabilities as referenced in the mfsa2019-07 advisory.<br><br>  - A use-after-free vulnerability can occur when a raw     pointer to a DOM element on a page is obtained using     JavaScript and the element is then removed while still     in use. This results in a potentially exploitable crash.<br>    (CVE-2019-9790)<br><br>  - The type inference system allows the compilation of     functions that can cause type confusions between     arbitrary objects when compiled through the IonMonkey     just-in-time (JIT) compiler and when the constructor     function is entered through on-stack replacement (OSR).<br>    This allows for possible arbitrary reading and writing     of objects during an exploitable crash. (CVE-2019-9791)<br><br>  - The IonMonkey just-in-time (JIT) compiler can leak an     internal JSOPTIMIZEDOUT magic value to the     running script during a bailout. This magic value can     then be used by JavaScript to achieve memory corruption,     which results in a potentially exploitable crash.<br>    (CVE-2019-9792)<br><br>  - A mechanism was discovered that removes some bounds     checking for string, array, or typed array accesses if     Spectre mitigations have been disabled. This     vulnerability could allow an attacker to create an     arbitrary value in compiled JavaScript, for which the     range analysis will infer a fully controlled, incorrect     range in circumstances where users have explicitly     disabled Spectre mitigations.  Note: Spectre     mitigations are currently enabled for all users by     default settings. (CVE-2019-9793)<br><br>  - A vulnerability was discovered where specific command     line arguments are not properly discarded during Firefox     invocation as a shell handler for URLs. This could be     used to retrieve and execute files whose location is     supplied through these command line arguments if Firefox     is configured as the default URI handler for a given URI     scheme in third party applications and these     applications insufficiently sanitize URL data.     Note: This issue only affects Windows operating systems.<br>    Other operating systems are unaffected. (CVE-2019-9794)<br><br>  - A vulnerability where type-confusion in the IonMonkey     just-in-time (JIT) compiler could potentially be used by     malicious JavaScript to trigger a potentially     exploitable crash. (CVE-2019-9795)<br><br>  - A use-after-free vulnerability can occur when the SMIL     animation controller incorrectly registers with the     refresh driver twice when only a single registration is     expected. When a registration is later freed with the     removal of the animation controller element, the refresh     driver incorrectly leaves a dangling pointer to the     driver's observer array. (CVE-2019-9796)<br><br>  - Cross-origin images can be read in violation of the     same-origin policy by exporting an image after using     createImageBitmap to read the image and     then rendering the resulting bitmap image within a     canvas element. (CVE-2019-9797)<br><br>  - On Android systems, Firefox can load a library from     APITRACELIB, which is writable by all users     and applications. This could allow malicious third party     applications to execute a man-in-the-middle attack if a     malicious code was written to that location and loaded.<br>     Note: This issue only affects Android. Other     operating systems are unaffected. (CVE-2019-9798)<br><br>  - Insufficient bounds checking of data during inter-     process communication might allow a compromised content     process to be able to read memory from the parent     process under certain conditions. (CVE-2019-9799)<br><br>  - Firefox will accept any registered Program ID as an     external protocol handler and offer to launch this local     application when given a matching URL on Windows     operating systems. This should only happen if the     program has specifically registered itself as a URL     Handler in the Windows registry.  Note: This issue     only affects Windows operating systems. Other operating     systems are unaffected. (CVE-2019-9801)<br><br>  - If a Sandbox content process is compromised, it can     initiate an FTP download which will then use a child     process to render the downloaded data. The downloaded     data can then be passed to the Chrome process with an     arbitrary file length supplied by an attacker, bypassing     sandbox protections and allow for a potential memory     read of adjacent data from the privileged Chrome     process, which may include sensitive data.<br>    (CVE-2019-9802)<br><br>  - The Upgrade-Insecure-Requests (UIR) specification states     that if UIR is enabled through Content Security Policy     (CSP), navigation to a same-origin URL must be upgraded     to HTTPS. Firefox will incorrectly navigate to an HTTP     URL rather than perform the security upgrade requested     by the CSP in some circumstances, allowing for potential     man-in-the-middle attacks on the linked resources.<br>    (CVE-2019-9803)<br><br>  - In Firefox Developer Tools it is possible that pasting     the result of the 'Copy as cURL'  command into a command     shell on macOS will cause the execution of unintended     additional bash script commands if the URL was     maliciously crafted. This is the result of an issue with     the native version of Bash on macOS.  Note: This     issue only affects macOS. Other operating systems are     unaffected. (CVE-2019-9804)<br><br>  - A latent vulnerability exists in the Prio library where     data may be read from uninitialized memory for some     functions, leading to potential memory corruption.<br>    (CVE-2019-9805)<br><br>  - A vulnerability exists during authorization prompting     for FTP transaction where successive modal prompts are     displayed and cannot be immediately dismissed. This     allows for a denial of service (DOS) attack.<br>    (CVE-2019-9806)<br><br>  - When arbitrary text is sent over an FTP connection and a     page reload is initiated, it is possible to create a     modal alert message with this text as the content. This     could potentially be used for social engineering     attacks. (CVE-2019-9807)<br><br>  - If the source for resources on a page is through an FTP     connection, it is possible to trigger a series of modal     alert messages for these resources through invalid     credentials or locations. These messages cannot be     immediately dismissed, allowing for a denial of service     (DOS) attack. (CVE-2019-9809)<br><br>  - If WebRTC permission is requested from documents with     data: or blob: URLs, the permission notifications do not     properly display the originating domain. The     notification states Unknown origin as the requestee,     leading to user confusion about which site is asking for     this permission. (CVE-2019-9808)<br><br>  - Mozilla developers and community members Dragana     Damjanovic, Emilio Cobos lvarez, Henri Sivonen, Narcis     Beleuzu, Julian Seward, Marcia Knous, Gary Kwong, Tyson     Smith, Yaron Tausky, Ronald Crane, and Andr Bargull     reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 65. Some     of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and     we presume that with enough effort that some of these     could be exploited to run arbitrary code.<br>    (CVE-2019-9789)<br><br>  - Mozilla developers and community members Bob Clary,     Chun-Min Chang, Aral Yaman, Andreea Pavel, Jonathan Kew,     Gary Kwong, Alex Gaynor, Masayuki Nakano, and Anne van     Kesteren reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox     65 and Firefox ESR 60.5.
